                        the most interesting part for shopping is between the Grote Markt to where the Grote Houtstraat meets with the Raamvest / Gasthuissinge,Lined with the usual global giants such as the Apple store, Zara, H&M and Esprit, the Grote Houtstraat is also home to the usual Dutch high-street chains like Blokker, Etos, Intertoys, WE Fashion and (of course) there’s an Albert Heijn.

                            <p>
                                Taekwondo is a combative sport and was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate, Chinese martial arts, and indigenous Korean martial arts traditions such as Taekkyon, Subak, and Gwonbeop.
                                 The oldest governing body for Taekwondo is the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by representatives from the nine original kwans, or martial arts schools, in Korea.
